Plugin Information & Usage:

This is a simple 'plug & play' plugin that allows you to view your existing Users in a more user-friendly UI. The existing Wordpress core User list is informative, but can be difficult to traverse as your User count grows.

After installing/activating the plugin, you'll find the plugin titled UserReviewExpress in your Wordpress dashboard. Navigating to the plugin will present you the default view - a current list of ALL users on your site in a more readable format, and also by default, sorting by Administrators first (always highlighted in green), followed by the other users of non-admin roles.

Additionally, you can sort these users alphabetically. This removes the default ordering of Admins, however, click the 'Refresh View' button to set the User view to the default view again. You can make a search query for a user by name, and all relevant users will be presented to you. There is pagination included and user-per-page count specifications you can set for broader search results.

Another small feature is the 'View Log Events' button, which is a very basic log file that contains all the login time events of your users, including location (I.P.) information. 

- Please note, you'll see all your users will be set to 'Has not signed in' at first. This is because the plugin has just been installed and can not retroactively populate this data, after some time you will see user events and login timestamps populate.
